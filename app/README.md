# Flask app information

## src

contains all of the python files that clean the data, make the models, load the models, do the predictiosn, everything is in there.

There are a few files in there from the older version of this project. anything that has a 2 is for the current models. Anything that has only one file is also current. Keeping older versions for refrence and possible use in the future.

## static

in the class and ers filders under static is where the pickled models and transformer are held. They're not there right now as the information stored in them contains some confidential data.

### not fully finished

Most of the site is done. The index.html page is not updated for the new model types. It's still using the older project information.

The data displayed on the ers and class pages is not fomratted well. If I have spare time I'll try to fix these things.
